- Follow Google C++ Style Guide
- Start error messages with a lowercase letter unless it is a proper noun or variable name
- Never reorder `#include`
- Build, save perf data, or save flamegraphs to ./build
- Try searching the FlameGraph lib in ../
- In GPU device code, registers are limited and memory access is expensive.
  Avoid use of `memcpy`, `memset`, and `reinterpret_cast`.
  Prefer plain assignments. Prefer `int4` for types larger than 8B.
