 * # 1bit Truncation for Output Group
 *
 * For a group element, though it is stored as lambda bytes, only lambda * 8 - 1 bits are used.
 * Its MSB is always 0, and set to 0 if any input is not.
 * Taking DPF as an example, we do this because DPF requires a PRG that has lambda bytes -> 2 * lambda + 2 bytes, and we make lambda = kLambda * 8 - 1.
 * We choose MSB to be unset because we can truncate it during adding, which is easy to handle.
